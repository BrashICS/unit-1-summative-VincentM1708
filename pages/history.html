<h7>Short Summary</h7>
  <h5>
    Mark was born May 14, 1984 into a comfortable educated family. Mark developped an interest in computers at the early age of 12 and he used Atari BASIC to create his first messaging program called "Zucknet." His family started to use it and with friends would create computer games just for fun.
